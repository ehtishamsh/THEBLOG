          A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on a webpage.
          It is a series of vertical and horizontal lines that create a matrix
          of intersecting points, which can be used to align and organize page
          elements. Grid systems are used to create a consistent look and feel
          across a website, and can help to make the layout more visually
          appealing and easier to navigate.

          If youâ€™ve been to New York City and have walked the streets, it is
          easy to figure out how to get from one place to another because of the
          grid system that the city is built on. Just as the predictability of a
          city grid helps locals and tourists get around easily, so do webpage
          grids provide a structure that guides users and designers alike.
          Because of their consistent reference point, grids improve page
          readability and scannability and allow people to quickly get where
          they need to go.
